#### There are currently two types of modes 
#### requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution & preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
#### To apply a label to a node
#### kubectl label nodes <nodename> key=value
#### Sample deployment for nodeAffinity, first we need to check the value using 
#### kubectl describe node <nodename> | less OR grep for node affinity
